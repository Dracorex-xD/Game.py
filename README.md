# Game.py
 Im sooo bored imma make a game in Python
 
 Literally just run the code in an ide
 I think it automatically makes the __pychache__ folder so no need 
 to make one
 - You have to type the exact strings when you are choosing which
 test you wanna take

 - Tou can modify the numbers to give yourself a challenge I guess
